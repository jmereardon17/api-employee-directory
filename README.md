# Techdegree Project 8

For this project, I had to use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees", and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. I had to request a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's grid card will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to:

- Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, I needed to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. I also needed to write functionality that filters results once they are already on the page.
- Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.

Browsers tested for compatibility:
- Chrome
