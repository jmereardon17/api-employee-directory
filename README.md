# API Employee Directory

Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other. This is a treehouse FEWD project where I had to use the public Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees", and use that data to build a prototype for an employee directory. I had to request a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's grid card will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.

Further work to achieve the highest grading was developed for this project:
- Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, I needed to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. I also needed to write functionality that filters results once they are already on the page.
- Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
