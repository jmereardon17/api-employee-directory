# API Employee Directory

An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a start way for employees to share contact information with each other. Using the Random User Generator API, 12 random "employees" data is used to prototype an employee directory in a grid, which includes their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's grid card will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.
